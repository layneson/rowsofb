you know how the world is mysterious...
we dont know what is outside our little spheres...
[with the devil's lettuce,] we can explore space, the fabric of time...
we can look through the atoms of life, the nitty-gritty...
feel the unfeelable, touch the untouchable...
reach a level of zen that is... beyond...
